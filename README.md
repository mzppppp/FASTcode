# FAST Pulsar Project by Jieming (Tom) Luan
## About the Project
* This project is about classifying potential pulsar candidates using statistical modelling. The main tools we used were Python and Topcat.
* Two million data rows were selected from FAST and GAIA DR3 using SQL.
* Visualized these data in Topcat by crossmatching source tables to filter out the outliers.
* Identified 961 pulsars out of over 2,000,000 candidates using standard deviation and parallax in Python.
* The attached file is in step 4 when we are cutting the stars outside three standard deviations
## Tools and Modules Used
* Topcat; Python(Matplotlib, Astropy, Numpy, csv); Excel; DS9.
* All the tools are running in a MacOS 10.13
## Installation of the Tools
* Topcat https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/
* Anaconda Python 3.7 https://www.anaconda.com/download
* DS9 https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9
## Help
I would like to thank the research opportunity in National Astronomical Observatory of China, and the help from my supevisors (Dr. Sean Lake and Dr. Di Li).
My supevisors helped me a lot on my research and coding skills and astronomical and Python tools usage. Thank you so much!
## Impact
The research gave a complete pulsar candidate list, taking from two million stars in the selected area. Proving that the pulsar search by FAST is efficient and accurate.
